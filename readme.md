## Simple registration for EDD

Adds simple registration forms to Easy Digital Downloads. **Requires PHP 5.6+**.

### Description

This plugin makes it easy to include a registration form for EDD stores.

Use the `[edd_simple_registration]` shortcode to display the registration form on your site. You can optionally add a few attributes:

- `button` = changes the text for the form submission button
- `show_names` = override the global setting to show name fields (accepts "yes" or "no")
- `require_names` = override the global setting to require name fields (accepts "yes" or "no")
 
This makes it easy to create new users, which could be synced to additional apps, such as [Jilt](https://jilt.com/).

Inspired by [WC Simple Registration](https://github.com/Astoundify/wc-simple-registration) from Astoundify.

### Development

Be sure to follow WordPress development guidelines.
